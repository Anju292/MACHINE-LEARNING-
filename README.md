### TASK 1
 
## OUTLIER DETECTION AND CORRELATION ANALYSIS
Dataset = https://drive.google.com/file/d/137w_fwScAJtSbteo_HL0BxqhtJ9Gocsr/view?usp=sharing

This project analyzes Bangalore property prices, focusing on price per square foot. Steps include: data loading, outlier detection (mean, percentile, IQR, normal distribution, Z-score), visualization (box plots, histogram), correlation analysis (heatmap, scatter plots), yielding insights like strong correlations between square footage and price.
It includes:

- Data Loading: Load "house_price.csv" with features like square footage, bathrooms, bedrooms, and price.

- Outlier Detection: Use mean, percentile, IQR, normal distribution, and Z-score methods to identify and remove outliers.

- Data Visualization: Utilize box plots and histograms to visualize data spread and assess normality.

- Correlation Analysis: Calculate correlations between features, visualize with a heatmap, and examine scatter plots for linear relationships.

- Insights: Findings include strong correlations between square footage and bathrooms/price, weaker correlations with bedrooms, and moderate positive correlations with other features in price per square foot.

### TASK 2

## HYPOTHESIS TESTING

1. **Objective:**
   - Determine if a claim about a population parameter is supported by sample data.

2. **Null Hypothesis (\( H_0 \)):**
   - Assumption that there is no significant difference or effect.
   
3. **Alternative Hypothesis (\( H_1 \)):**
   - Contrary to the null hypothesis, stating there is a significant difference or effect.

4. **Test Statistic:**
   - A numerical value computed from sample data used to assess the truth of the null hypothesis.

5. **Significance Level (\( \alpha \)):**
   - Threshold for accepting or rejecting the null hypothesis, typically set at 0.05.

6. **Critical Value:**
   - Threshold value beyond which the null hypothesis is rejected.

7. **Decision Rule:**
   - Criteria used to decide whether to reject the null hypothesis based on the test statistic and critical value.

8. **Conclusion:**
   - Final determination based on the decision rule, indicating whether there is enough evidence to support the alternative hypothesis.
