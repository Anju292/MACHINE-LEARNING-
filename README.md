### TASK 1
 
## OUTLIER DETECTION AND CORRELATION ANALYSIS

This project analyzes Bangalore property prices, focusing on price per square foot. Steps include: data loading, outlier detection (mean, percentile, IQR, normal distribution, Z-score), visualization (box plots, histogram), correlation analysis (heatmap, scatter plots), yielding insights like strong correlations between square footage and price.
It includes:

- Data Loading: Load "house_price.csv" with features like square footage, bathrooms, bedrooms, and price.

- Outlier Detection: Use mean, percentile, IQR, normal distribution, and Z-score methods to identify and remove outliers.

- Data Visualization: Utilize box plots and histograms to visualize data spread and assess normality.

- Correlation Analysis: Calculate correlations between features, visualize with a heatmap, and examine scatter plots for linear relationships.

- Insights: Findings include strong correlations between square footage and bathrooms/price, weaker correlations with bedrooms, and moderate positive correlations with other features in price per square foot.
